### Helpful stuff
1. Name of the kivy .py file should always be main.py<br>
2. Check buildozer.spec file and un-comment the permissions it requires, else the app crashes<br>
3. When running the buildozer debug run for the first time, make sure you use verbose and allow for permissions and accept the agreement. The first run may take a while to complete.<br>
